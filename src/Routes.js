// Import react becuase the Route itself is a component
import React from 'react';
// Import the Route, and Switch Comopnent used for defining your routes
// Route is the route itself which can accept render props, but for the purpose of this tutorial we used the component and path prop
// Switch responsible for directing to first child that matches thier respective route
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
// Now import the components you'll pass as props
import Home from './components/container/Home/Home';
import About from './components/container/About/About';
import Cart from './components/container/Cart/Cart';

// When dealing with default exports we do not even need to name the export since when it is imported we can name it whatever we want
export default (
    <Switch>
        {/*Use the exact keyword means it will direct to that exact route, and used primarily when creating sub routes. */}
        <Route exact path='/' component={Home} />
        <Route path='/about' component={About} />
        <Route path='/cart' component={Cart} />
    </Switch>
